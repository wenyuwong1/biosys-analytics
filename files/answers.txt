$ wc -l foo 
 
50 foo

> You might have expected that the total number of lines in the previous question would be 45 (15 * 3), 
  but it should not be. Why is it more or less?
$ There are more lines than expected because when the files were appendeded, it provided information
  of which file the "head -15" text came from. Additionally, there are empty lines to make it more human
  readable. 

> Remove the file called "foo"
$ rm -i foo

rm: remove regular file `foo'? y

> Do "history > cmds"
$ history > cmds
