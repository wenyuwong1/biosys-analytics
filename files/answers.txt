##! $ Commands used to answer the Question

> Create a files directory

> Show a long listing of the files

> Show a command that will find the files in this directory which are larger than 50k
$ find . -type f –size 50k

> Show a command that will tell you what kind of file that Unix considers "const.txt"
$ file const.txt 

> Show a single command that will print the MD5 sum of all the text files (without mentioning each
  file individually)
$ md5sum *.txt

> Show the output of a command that will tell you how much disk space in kilobytes (K) is being used
$ df -k

> Show a command to count how many lines of text contain the word "judge" (irrespective of case) in 
  all the files
$ grep –io “judge” *.txt|wc -l

> Show a command that will display only the names of the files that contain the word "human"

> Show a single command that will count the number of times the word "scarlet" appears in

  occurrence of the word
$ grep -io “scarlet” scarlet.txt | wc -l

> Show a single command that will take the first 15 lines from each file and append them into a new 
  file called "foo"
$ head –15 *.txt >> foo

> Show a command that shows how many lines are in "foo"
$ wc -l foo 
 
> You might have expected that the total number of lines in the previous question would be 45 (15 * 3), 
  but it should not be. Why is it more or less?
$ There are more lines than expected because when the files were appendeded, it provided information
  of which file the "head -15" text came from. Additionally, there are empty lines to make it more human
  readable. 

> Remove the file called "foo"
$ rm -i foo

> Do "history > cmds"
$ history > cmds
