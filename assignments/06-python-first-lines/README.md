# Python Dictionaries

Create a program called "first_lines.py" that prints the first line of the contents of each file in a directory along with the source file name, e.g., like the index of a collection of poems. The program must do the following:

* Print a "usage" statement if given exactly no arguments and exit *with an error*
* Accept one or more positional arguments which should be directory names (hint: use `nargs='+'` to `argparse` to get a list instead of a single value)
* Iterate over the arguments; if an argument is not a directory, print '"<arg>" is not a directory' *to STDERR* and skip to the next
* Print the directory name, then show a **sorted** list of first lines of the files contained in that directory, ellipses, then the file name

Expected behavior:

````
$ ./first_lines.py
usage: first_lines.py [-h] [-w int] DIR [DIR ...]
first_lines.py: error: the following arguments are required: DIR
$ ./first_lines.py foo
"foo" is not a directory
$ ./first_lines.py whitman
