# Bash Scripting

In this exercise you will create two scripts that focus on using `for` loops and arguments in bash.

# cat -n

The `cat` program is used to "concatenate" files together, but it's often abused to simply spit out a short files so you can look at the contents without using a text editor or a pager like `more` or `less`. Another common task is to use the `-n` flag to "number" the lines of output:

````
$ cat -n files/sonnet-29.txt
     1	Sonnet 29
     2	William Shakespeare
     3
     4	When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,
     5	I all alone beweep my outcast state,
     6	And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
     7	And look upon myself and curse my fate,
     8	Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
     9	Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
    10	Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,
    11	With what I most enjoy contented least;
    12	Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
    13	Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
    14	(Like to the lark at break of day arising
    15	From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate;
    16	For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
    17	That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
````

You will create a bash script called "cat-n.sh" that mimics this output. Here are the expectations of your program:

* Your program will expect to receive an argument in `$1`
* If there are no arguments, it should print a "Usage" and exit *with an error code*
* If the argument is not a file, it should notify the user and exit *with an error code*
* It will iterate over the lines in the file and print the line number, a space, and the line of the file
* Your output will differ from regular `cat -n` as I won't expect you to right-align the numbers. 

Here is the expected behavior:

````
$ ./cat-n.sh
Usage: cat-n.sh FILE
$ ./cat-n.sh files/
files/ is not a file
$ ./cat-n.sh files/sonnet-29.txt
1 Sonnet 29
2 William Shakespeare
3
4 When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,
5 I all alone beweep my outcast state,
6 And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
7 And look upon myself and curse my fate,
8 Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
9 Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
10 Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,
11 With what I most enjoy contented least;
12 Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
13 Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
14 (Like to the lark at break of day arising
15 From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate;
16 For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
17 That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

# head.sh

Write a bash script that mimics the "head" utility where it will print the first few lines of a file.  The script should expect one required argument (the file) and a second optional argument of the number of lines, defaulting to 3.

You will create a bash script called "head.sh" that mimics this output. Here are the expectations of your program:

* Your program will expect to receive an argument in `$1` and maybe a second in `$2`
* If there are no arguments, it should print a "Usage" and exit *with an error code*
* If the first argument is not a file, it should notify the user and exit *with an error code*
* If the second argument is missing, use the value "3"
* Print the number of lines requested by the user by iterating over the lines in the file and exiting the loop appropriately
* Do not use the actual `head` command!

# Testing

You have been provided a `Makefile` that will run a test suite. This is what it should look like when all tests are passing:

````

The first test is that the files exist. Then they are tested with no arguments to see if they produce "usage"-type help messages. Then they are tested with bad input. Then they are tested that they produce the expected output when given good input.

This is the basis of "test-driven design" (TDD). We define a set of tests that describe what working software should do. When the tests pass, the software is done. When you are passing all the tests, you are done! 

# Commit

Remember that I can't `pull` your work until it's been `push`ed it to GitHub.

$ git add head.sh cat-n.sh
$ git commit -m 'homework 2' head.sh cat-n.sh
$ git push
