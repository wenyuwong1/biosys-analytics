# BE 434/535 Final Spring 2019

Go into your repository and `git pull upstream master`. There will be a `finals` directory.

For the exam, undergraduates should select one problem from the `undergrad` directory. Your choices are as follows:

* histogram: take positional integer arguments and create a textual histogram
* upgoer: find words in an input that are not in the list of 1000 common words
* piggie: convert text in string or file argument into Pig Latin

**Graduates can either solve two problems from the `undergrad` directory or one from the `grad`.** The problems there are:

* au_pair: FASTA read-pair separator
* averager: find numbers in files and print the average
* piggie: convert text in multiple files into Pig Latin

When you are done, be sure to add/commit/push your solution to GitHub. Send me an email with your choice, an(s).
