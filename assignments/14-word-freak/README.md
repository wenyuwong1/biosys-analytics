# Word Frequencies 

Write a Python program named `freak.py` that takes one or more positional arguments of file names and counts the number of times each word occurs in the text. You will need to remove any non-letters from each word (e.g., punctuation so that "foo," becomes "foo") and count irrespective of case (so "foo," "Foo," and "FOO" are all the same word). Your program should also accept `-s|--sort` option that allows the user to choose the output to be sorted by "word" (alphabetically, this is the default) or "frequency" (numerically in ascending order) as well as a `-m|--min` option that is an integer value indicating the minimum number of times a word must occur to be included in the output (default 0).

As you read each file into words, you may choose to use a regular expression to remove anything that is not a letter or number, e.g.:

````
>>> import re
>>> re.sub('[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', 'f)0o_,b@a,>r!')
'f0obar'
````

I used a `defaultdict(int)` structure for my word counter, but you might also want to consider a `Counter`, both from the `collections` module.

The output should be formatted with:

````
print('{:20} {}'.format(word, count))
````

To find out how to sort a dicitionary by values rather than words, cf. https://github.com/hurwitzlab/biosys-analytics/blob/master/lectures/08-python-patterns/python-common-patterns.md#sort-a-dictionary-by-values.

You will be given bad input files, but you need not create a specific error message but only throw an error on bad files. For this exercise, I chose to use a `type=argparse.FileType('r', encoding='UTF-8')` for my `file` argument which causes `argparse` to throw the error rather than me checking the input. This is because I don't need to know the *name* of the file in my output, so I just rely on `argparse` to give me a list of filehandles to read!

# Expected Behavior

````
$ ./freak.py
usage: freak.py [-h] [-s str] [-m int] FILE [FILE ...]

Print word frequencies

positional arguments:
  FILE                File input(s)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -s str, --sort str  Sort by word or frequency (default: word)
  -m int, --min int   Minimum count (default: 0)
