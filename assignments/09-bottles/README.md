# Bottles of Beer Song

Write a Python program called `bottles.py` that takes a single option `-n|--num_bottles` which is an positive integer (default 10) and prints the "<N> bottles of beer on the wall song." If the `-n` argument is less than 1, die with "N (<N>) must be a positive integer". The program should also respond to `-h|--help` with a usage statement.

I'd encourage you to think about the program as a formal algorithm. Read the introduction to Jeff Erickson's book _Algorithms_ available here:

You are going to need to count down, so you'll need to consider how to do that. First, let's examine a list and see how it can be sorted and reversed. We've already used the `sorted` *function*, but we haven't really talked about the `list` class's `sort` *method*. Note that the former does not mutate the list itself:

````
>>> a = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
>>> sorted(a)
['bar', 'baz', 'foo']
>>> a
['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
````

But the `sort` method does:

````
>>> a.sort()
>>> a
['bar', 'baz', 'foo']
````

Also, note what is returned by `sort`:

````
>>> type(a.sort())
<type 'NoneType'>
````

So if you did this, you'd destroy your data:

````
>>> a = a.sort()
>>> a
````

As with `sort`/`sorted`, so it goes with `reverse`/`reversed`. The past participle version *returns a new copy of the data without affecting the original* and is therefore the safest bet to use:

````
>>> a = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
>>> a
['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
>>> reversed(a)
<listreverseiterator object at 0x10f0d61d0>
>>> list(reversed(a))
['baz', 'bar', 'foo']
>>> a
['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
````

Compare with:

````
>>> a.reverse()
>>> a
['baz', 'bar', 'foo']
````

Given that and your knowledge of how `range` works, can you figure out how to count down, say, from 10 to 1?
