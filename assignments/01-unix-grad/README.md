# Graduate Unix Exercises

For these exercises, you should keep working with the same "files" from the first ("01-unix") assigment. Create a file in *this* directory called "answers.txt" with your cut/pasted answers.

* Show a single command that will calculate the number of words in the files whose names start with either "c" or "s"; the command must use a pattern and not list the files individually
* Show a command that will show the lines that begin with "Article" followed by a space and a number
* Show a command that will count the number of empty lines in "const.txt"
* Show a command that will find all the lines in "scarlet.txt" that begin with a vowel (case-insensitive) and shows you a count by letter like the output in Table 1
* Do "history > cmds"

Table 1: Expected output for "scarlet.txt" lines beginning with a vowel (don't worry if you get slightly different numbers).
