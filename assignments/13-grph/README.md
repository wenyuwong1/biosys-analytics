# De Bruijn Graphs in Python

We will find paths through sequences that could aid in assembly (cf http://rosalind.info/problems/grph/). For this exercise, we will only attempt to join any two sequences together. To do this, we will look at the last `k` characters of every sequence and find where the first `k` character of a *different* sequence are the same. 

For example, in this file:

````
$ cat sample1.fa
>Rosalind_0498
AAATAAA
>Rosalind_2391
AAATTTT
>Rosalind_2323
TTTTCCC
>Rosalind_0442
AAATCCC
>Rosalind_5013
GGGTGGG
````

If `k` is 3, then the last 3-mer of sequence 498 is "AAA" which is also the first 3-mer of 2391 and 442. "TTT" ends 2391 and starts 2323, so the graphs we could create from 3-mers would be:

````
$ ./grph.py -k 3 sample1.fa
Rosalind_0498 Rosalind_2391
Rosalind_0498 Rosalind_0442
Rosalind_2391 Rosalind_2323
````

You will write a Python program called `grph.py` which will take a `-k|--overlap` option with a default value of `3` and a single positional argument of an input file which will be in FASTA format. I would recommend you read all the sequences and build two data structures that hold the k-mers at the beginnings and ends of your sequences. You should go through all the ending kmers and see if there are any sequences that begin with that string. It does not matter what order you emit the pairs as they will be sorted on the command line for the tests.

Similar to the HAMM assignment, `test.py` will `import grph` and specifically test for a `grph.find_kmers` function which should be defined as taking a string and a integer representing `k` for the returned kmers. If you inspected the test, you should see how to write the function and what it should return:

````
def test_find_kmers():
    """Test the `find_kmers` function"""
    assert grph.find_kmers('ACTG', 2) == ['AC', 'CT', 'TG']
    assert grph.find_kmers('ACTG', 3) == ['ACT', 'CTG']
    assert grph.find_kmers('ACTG', 4) == ['ACTG']
````

Note that the code you need has already been written (https://github.com/hurwitzlab/biosys-analytics/blob/master/lectures/08-python-patterns/python-common-patterns.md#extract-k-mers-from-a-string).

# Test Suite

A passing test suite looks like this (NB: you can use `pytest -v test.py` instead of `make test`):

````
