# Pig Latin

Make a "Pig Latin" version of a given word with the following rules:

1. If the word begins with consonants, e.g., "k" or "ch", move them to the end of the word and append "ay" so that "mouse" becomes "ouse-may" and "chair" becomes "air-chay."
2. If the word begins with a vowel, simple append "-ay" to the end, so "apple" is "apple-ay."
